To achieve any of these goals requires careful planning and structure; not solely licence management and discovery tool-sets. With a structured understanding of your environments supported by well versed software management processes, comes a solid foundation for a new and improved SAM system.',

At Infraware we understand the importance of ‘asset classification, relationships and data flows’ to ensure a ‘contextual’ view of an asset base. Microsoft has employed our services to draft global usage processes for some of their largest cloud contracts and we continue to work with hosting organisations globally. With the technology progression comes a skills shortage; it is estimated that by 2018 there will be upto a 50% skills shortage in the SAM industry (Source: Gartner 2017). We must find a way to locate the middle ground of acceptable standards and best practice.',

However, with the onset of new technology and the expected skills shortage (Gartner 2017) it is imperative that we use every means possible to visually display how software is managed and moves into and around our organisations. IoT, BYOD and many other aspects of IT will impact how we adapt our SAM best practices. Understanding the contex of your source of truth; why there are data quality issues or low coverage percentages all require an in-depth understanding of how your business manages software.',
